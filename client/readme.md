## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.
There were certain difficulties in developing the Music Melody web app. Designing a user interface that was both aesthetically pleasing and responsive was a big challenge for improving the user experience. The handling of routing for various pages also requires careful planning and code. These issues were, however, effectively resolved by help of lab1 and problem-solving, leading to a refined and user-friendly  application.
